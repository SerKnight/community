			.creator-hiw-box-underline
			.creator-hiw-box-body
				Share your adventure page with your friends, network and the AdventureMade community. Interested travelers can follow your trip or message the guide to get more information. The trip will launch (have a guaranteed departure) when the minimum capacity is reached.

				Once the trip launches, each additional traveler who joins the crew will decrease everyone's individual price. After the applications close or the maximum capacity is reached, it's time to pack your bags and embark on your custom shared adventure.

			Those who jump at any chance to get a snag a cheap flight or hitch a ride to unexplored places. We want travelers who travel not to get from point A to B but to experience new cultures, meet new people, and seek memorable experiences. Most importantly, we're looking for those who don't wait for a trip to land in their lap, but are always planning the next trip.

			The Social Influencer

			<br>
			Your Instagram feed is the talk of your friend group and your Facebook page reads like an adventure resume. Friends and family go to you for travel advice and many would jump at the opportunity to travel with you. Whether it's your pictures, stories, personality, or all three, you're doing something right. Spreading travel is spreading happiness.
