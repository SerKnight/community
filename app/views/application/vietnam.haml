			Whoa, What's This?
		.description-body
			Adventure is uncertainty and pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone. We don't believe in travel tours that hold your hand and feed you your meals, which is why we're choosing 8 ballsy travelers to conquer Vietnam on motorcycles. 
			<br>
			<br> 
			We've set up the necessities and key aspects of the trip...but, this trip is not going to be easy and things are going to go wrong. In the end, it'll be what wasn't planned that creates the stories you'll be bragging about for decades to come.
