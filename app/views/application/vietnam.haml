			Whoa, What's This?
		.description-body
			Adventure is uncertainty and pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone. We don't believe in travel tours that hold your hand and feed you your meals, which is why we're choosing 4 teams of ballsy travelers to conquer Vietnam on motorcycles. 
			<br>
			<br> 
			We've set up the necessities and key aspects of the trip...but, this trip is not going to be easy and things are going to go wrong. In the end, it'll be what wasn't planned that creates the stories you'll be bragging about for decades to come.

Meet the other travelers, have a beer, eat and relax because tomorrow begins our long trek south.<br><br>The following day, you’ll want to rise and shine early, enjoy one of many Vietnamese coffees to come and hop on your new home for the next two weeks; a new CRF250 ready to take on the challenges ahead with you. Your team will decide when you'll leave, which road you'll take and where you'll be heading on your first day’s ride.<br><br>You’ll be escaping the city and slowly realizing you’re very far from home. Although the poorest province in Vietnam, Nghệ An is the largest and home to serious agriculture production. You’ll be riding past corn, bananas, onions, rice, cassava, tea, oranges, cinnamon, eucalyptus and the largest dairy producer in Vietnam. If you stick to the Ho Chi Minh Road, you’ll edge closer to the mountains, which signify the border of Laos.<br><br>Remember the words 'Nhà Nghỉ', this is your magic phrase to find yourself a guest house in one of the many little villages along the Ho Chi Minh Road after our first day on the road. Those who are feeling comfy on their bikes can shoot down as far as Pho Chau, a 380km ride. For those feeling a bit less ballsy, Yên Cát and Thái Hòa are less of a journey to reach along the way. Just remember, the less you ride today, the more you'll have to ride tomorrow...and these roads aren’t going to get any easier.<br><br>An unfortunate and ongoing problem within these small towns near the border is dog smuggling. In many parts of Vietnam, particularly Hanoi, dog meat is considered a delicatessen and it’s estimated over 5 million dogs are consumed in the country each year. Trucks and corrupt officials associated with an international mafias have a known presence using the route through Pho Chau. I don’t recommend anyone gets involved in any way at all...but bonus points for every dog you let loose.", 'data-img-src' => "#{asset_url("background/hanoicityblock.jpg")}"}

I’ve set up local guides from the nearby village of Tan Hoa, who will pick us up first thing in the morning and help us make the most out of our adventure day in the Park. We’ll start by driving over the Da Deo Mountain Pass until we reach the Tan Hoa minority village.<br><br>A short 2 km hike through buffalo and peanut fields we’ll reach and cross the Rao Nan River and to our first cave; Hang Chuot. Otherwise known as ‘Rat Cave’, Hang Chuot used to be used as an illegal timber-logging trail to literally go under the mountain.<br><br>One cave experience isn’t enough, so we’ll be trekking through Hung Ton Valley to reach Hung Ton Cave. After descending 15 meters into the cave, we’ll have to swim through the cave, following an underground river to reach To Mo Valley. Thanks to our guides, they’re going to be setting up a local Vietnamese BBQ by a waterfall, which we’ll also be swimming in.<br><br>After the full day exploring we’ll most likely be anxious to get back on the saddle and split up until the next checkpoint.

One of the most important sites of the war, Khe Sanh was home to one of the bloodiest and longest battles of the American War.<br><br>In 1968, this small village was a large American base, purposefully chosen for its close proximity to the demilitarized zone between North and South Vietnam as well as the border of Laos. When the People’s Army of North Vietnam carried out a massive artillery bombardment on the base, a 77-day battle took place. Unfortunately, while the U.S. and South Vietnamese focused their attention on Khe Sanh, the forces of North Vietnam and Viet Cong unleased the Tet Offensive, in which more than 100 cities and towns in the South were under coordinated attacks by more than 70,000 soldiers.<br><br>While riding and staying in Khe Sanh, we’ll be surrounded by remnants of this bloody past, whether through old helicopters or the craters that mark the earth’s battle scars from the dropping of over 110,00 tons of bombs by the U.S. (the most intensive in the history of warfare), which was part of the relief force that concluded the Battle of Khe Sanh.<br><br>We’ll then head to our next major leg of the trip, from the Eastern Border to the Pacific Ocean. To keep our minds going on this country’s history we’ll go back another hundred years, into Hue; home of the last ruling family of Vietnam.<br><br>Even though many of its finest buildings were destroyed during the war, Hue’s history and beauty will be easy for us to find between the picturesque Perfume River and the walled area of the old Imperial City. Within this UNESCO World Heritage Site was once a forbidden city lined by citadel walls, where only emperors and those closest to them were granted access.
