/ %h1
/   Lets get to know a little about you..
/ %h6
/   this is where we can put logic.. 
/   based on which adventure they were on, we can connect them to either a vietnam / ecuador list
/   and people can start to see what other people are interested, with their facebook data..
/   from there you could start email drip campaigns for each set of people to complete the typeform 
/   onboarding page that could be integrated with stripe to take a down payment? 

/ = image_tag "#{current_user.avatar_url}?type=large"

/ = form_for(resource, as: resource_name, url: registration_path(resource_name), html: { method: :put }) do |f|
/   = devise_error_messages!
/   .field
/     = f.label :email
/     %br/
/     = f.email_field :email, autofocus: true
/   - if devise_mapping.confirmable? && resource.pending_reconfirmation?
/     %div
/       Currently waiting confirmation for: #{resource.unconfirmed_email}

/   %hr
/   %h4 
/     we can add more auto user info to be pulled form facebook. Lmk if you want me to show you where that is.
/   %br
/   %p
/     You can also prolly hide this in a div, and only show it when someone clicks a "Forgot Password?" btn or something?    
/   .field
/     = f.label :password
/     %i (leave blank if you don't want to change it)
/     %br/
/     = f.password_field :password, autocomplete: "off"
/   .field
/     = f.label :password_confirmation
/     %br/
/     = f.password_field :password_confirmation, autocomplete: "off"
/   .field
/     = f.label :current_password
/     %i (we need your current password to confirm your changes)
/     %br/
/     = f.password_field :current_password, autocomplete: "off"
/   .actions
/     = f.submit "Update"
/ %h3 Cancel my account / i'm not interested anymore...
/ %h7
/   This will delete the user, and from like rails admin or something where you can pull interested ppl's email lists, people can 'unsubscribe' from groups i guess? dont have to keep delete user in, but its here by default

/ %p
/   Unhappy? #{button_to "Cancel my account", registration_path(resource_name), data: { confirm: "Are you sure?" }, method: :delete}
