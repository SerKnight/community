				Over 50 miles of thunderous whitewater from high in the Colombian mountains to the sweaty jungles of the tropical rainforest. Cliff jumping, hammock camping, swimming in waterfalls, a lot of coffee, and nights under the stars.
			.final-sentence
				<br>
				Yes Mom, Colombia is a safe place to travel.

			We've partnered with our friend Jules from Expedition Colombia in Medellín to chart a unique route for this expedition. We’ll start high in the mountains outside of Medellín and end in the Colombian lowlands; 4 days, 3 nights, and a lot of water. On the return trip, Jules has agreed to drop us off in Guatape, to spend 2 nights in Pablo Escobar’s former summer retreat where we'll climb El Peñol and explore the unique lake side village.
			<br>
			<br> 
			This is in no way a packaged tour, it’s a team expedition. We’ll need 8 seriously adventurous travelers to get this journey off the ground. Bonus points to those who can speak spanish! We guarantee you'll end up with a few crazy stories to tell when the journey is over, and more than likely a few incredible friends.
