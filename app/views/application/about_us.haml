			We believe...
		#body-font.about_us_explanation
			Adventure lies where certainty ends and evolution can begin. Where positive development is possible due to the unexpected events, changes, challenges and unknown will shape you.
			<br>
			<br>
			We believe travel can be used as a force for good. It can evoke empathy, bring people together and tell meaningful stories. It can be a tool for wealth distribution and economic empowerment.
			<br>
			<br>
			We believe travel is frequently oversimplified; dominated by bucketlists, social media “likes”, and mass produced experiences and expectations. It's often dismissive of the needs of residents, ecosystems, and strangely enough, travelers themselves.
			<br>
			<br>
			By engaging people early to create shared experiences, we’re setting the stage for more accurate and well rounded stories. Stories that capture the spirit of a place and provide the lens for a more optimistic future. Stories of involvement, empowerment, and accurate representation. Stories of travel done right.
